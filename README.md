# Plinko

## What is plinko?

Plinko is a popular game of chance that is often played on television game shows and mobile/ PC. 
The game involves a large board with a series of pegs arranged in a grid pattern, and a number of slots at the bottom. 
The player drops a small disc or ball into the top of the board, and it bounces around on the pegs as it falls toward the bottom.
As the disc or ball moves through the pegs, it may hit one or more of them, changing its direction and speed. 
The goal of the game is to get the disc or ball to land in one of the slots at the bottom, each of which has a different prize associated with it.

Plinko is a game of pure luck, as the player has no control over where the disc or ball lands. 
It is often used as a fun and entertaining way to give away prizes or determine the order of contestants in a competition. 
The game has become a classic staple of many game shows and has entertained millions of viewers for decades.
